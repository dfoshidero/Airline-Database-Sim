# Airline Database Simulator

An Airline DBMS Simulator made using Python and SQL.

This Airline Database Simulator is a Python-based application designed for the exploration of SQL and database development. This project, part of a school module on Databases, provides a practical experience in connecting a Python application frontend to a Relational Database System (RDS) backend. It was explored as a means of developing understanding in database management in the context of a real-world-like airline system.

## Implemented Features
  - **Database Reset:** Easily reset the entire database to its original state.
  - **Data Display and Manipulation:** Fetch and display various data tables, such as Departures, Arrivals, Overall Flights Dashboard, Employees, Airports, and more. Also ability to **add record, edit record, and delete record.**
  - **Dynamic Data Retrieval:** Refresh tables to obtain updated data on each function call, to reflect the most recent database state.
  - **Data Validation:** Implemented to validate date and time formats, as well as forcing specific data retrieval through the use of drop-down menus with the GUI.
  - **User-Friendly Interface:** A tkinter-based GUI simplifies database interactions, making it accessible for all users.

## Technical Details 
  - **Languages:** Python, SQL.
  - **Libraries & Frameworks:** Tkinter (for GUI), SQLite3 (for database interactions)
  - **Database Management:** Test database developed in SQL Server Management Studio, data is exported as a **`.db`** file, and converted for sqlite3.

## Getting Started
  1. **Installation:** Ensure Python, as well as the tkinter and sqlite3 libraries, are installed on your machine.
  2. **Database Setup:** Place the **`AIRLINE_SIM_DATA.db`** file in your project directory.
  3. **Launch:** Run the Python script to start the simulator.
